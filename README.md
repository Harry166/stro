2. Create an account
3. Go to Settings > Access Tokens
4. Create a new token with `read` permissions
5. Add it to the `.env` file (optional - the app works without it)

### 3. Update Environment Variables

## How It Works

1. **Stock Analysis**: The system analyzes 20 popular stocks using technical indicators
2. **News Sentiment**: AI analyzes recent news articles for each stock using FinBERT
3. **Trend Detection**: Combines technical analysis (60%) and sentiment (40%) to score stocks
4. **Display**: Shows the top 10 trending stocks with scores above 0.6

## AI Integration

The project uses Hugging Face Transformers with the **FinBERT** model, specifically trained for financial sentiment analysis. This provides more accurate sentiment detection for stock-related news.

### Why AI is Important:
- **Sentiment Analysis**: AI can understand context and nuance in financial news
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies positive/negative trends from text
- **Scalability**: Can analyze hundreds of articles quickly
- **Accuracy**: Financial-specific models understand market terminology

## Hugging Face Permissions

For the Hugging Face API token, you only need:
- **Read access** to public models
- No special permissions required
- The token is optional (the app downloads models locally by default)

## Dark Mode Design

The website features a sophisticated dark color scheme:
- **Background**: Deep black (#0a0b0d) for reduced eye strain
- **Cards**: Dark gray (#1a1b23) with subtle borders
- **Accents**: Blue (#3b82f6) and green (#10b981) for positive trends
- **Text**: High contrast white (#e4e4e7) for readability
- **Charts**: Color-coded (green for gains, red for losses)

## Future Enhancements

- Add more technical indicators
- Include options flow analysis
- Add portfolio tracking
- Implement alerts for significant changes
- Add more AI models for comparison

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:
1. Make sure all dependencies are installed
2. Check that your NEWS_API_KEY is valid
3. Ensure you have internet connection for API calls
4. Check console for error messages
